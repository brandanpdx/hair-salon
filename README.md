# Epicodus Independent Project - March 20, 2020

### Created by: Brandan Sayarath

## Description

This is the Epicodus independent end-of-week assignment for Friday, March 20, 2020.  The purpose of this assignment is to create an MVC web application to help manage a hair salon's stylists and their clients. The salon owner should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist.  The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist.
